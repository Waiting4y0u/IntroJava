Lectures
===

I try to record all lectures, and upload to youtube. The playlist for this term is at [Spring 17 Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLK5RwQeVk5Yw_TW0LTouoJBTWzSM9HsG7).

I will try to create a more detailed list below.

* [Mon Jan 9 - Intro to the class](https://youtu.be/VXJej8rnAnA) - Introduction to the class (part of module 0)
* [Wed, Jan 11 - Variables and types](https://youtu.be/Sp5W1rh-xLk)
